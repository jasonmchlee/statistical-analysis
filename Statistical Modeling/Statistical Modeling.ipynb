title: "Statistical Modeling"

header: Modeling running times
In this exercise, I'll build three different models based on the data Runners. The data come from records of the Cherry Blossom Ten Mile Run, a foot race held in Washington, DC each spring.

Imagining I have been assigned the task of constructing a handicap for the runners, so that different runners can compare their times adjusting for their age and/or sex.

I will construct three different models using the linear model architecture. Each will have the "net" running time as a response and age and/or sex as explanatory variables.
